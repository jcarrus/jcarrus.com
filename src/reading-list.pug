  p #[+link('https://www.amazon.com/Lessons-History-Will-Durant/dp/143914995X', 'The Lessons of History')] is a 100 page distillation of the history and patterns of civilization.  Famed for their 11 volume "The Story of Civilization", this book offers a much condensed overview of the major patterns and themes.

  p #[+link('https://www.amazon.com/Peopleware-Productive-Projects-Tom-Demarco/dp/0932633056', 'Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams')] is a must read for anyone working in the software industry or tech.

I read the 1987 edition and it is quite humbling to see just how timeless this "technology" book is!obs
  +highlights
    li "The major problems of our work are not so much technological as sociological in nature. Most managers are willing to conceded the idea that they've got more people worries than technical worries. But they seldom manage that way. They manage as though technology were their principle concern. They spend their time puzzling over the most convoluted and most interesting puzzles that their people will have to solve, almost as though they themselves were going to do the work rather than manage it."
    li "Quality, far beyond that required by the end user, is a means to higher productivity." Japan is known both for quality and productivity. The secret lies in the worker's respect for their own craft.
    li "There are a million ways to lose a work day, but not even a single way to get one back."
    li "You probably don't feel that you have an uncontrollable tendency to hire attractive or 'normal' looking people... [but] you're hiring on behalf of the whole corporate ladder above you. The perceived norm of these upper managers is working on you each time you consider making a new offer."
    li "The term 'unprofessional' is often used to characterize surprising and threatening behavior. Anything that upsets the weak manager is almost by definition unprofessional."
    li "Believing that workers will automatically accept organizational goals is the sign of naive managerial optimism"
    li "Getting the system built was an arbitrary goal, but the team had accepted it. It was what they had formed around. From the time of jelling, the team itself has been the real focus for their energies. They were in it for the joint success, the pleasure of achieving the goal, any goal, together. Refocusing their attention on the company's interest in the project didn't help. It just made success seem trivial and meaningless."
    li "The purpose of a team is not goal attainment but goal alignment."
    li "The difference between a team and a clique is like the difference between a breeze and a draft." "If you find that cool current of air delightful, you call it a breeze; if you find it annoying, you call it a draft."
    li "The right to be right (in your manager's eyes or in your government's eyes) is irrelevant; it's only the right to be wrong that makes you free."
    li "Good managers provide frequent easy opportunities for the team to succeed together. The opportunities may be tiny pilot sub-projects, or demonstrations, or simulations, anything that gets the team quickly into the habit of succeeding together."
